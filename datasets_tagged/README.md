# Tagged Datasets

This folder contains the tagged datasets generated by the framework. Each file represents a dataset with metadata and tags that describe the quality and characteristics of the data.

## File Format

The tagged datasets are stored in JSON format. Each JSON file contains the following structure:

### JSON Structure

- **unitActions**: A list of actions performed by units in the dataset.
- **gameStates**: A list of game states corresponding to the actions.
- **gameBoard**: The representation of the game board.
- **tags**: Tags generated for the dataset, providing additional metadata.
- **notes**: Notes about the dataset, including the original file name.
- **properties**: Metadata about the dataset:
  - **id**: Unique identifier for the dataset.
  - **quality**: Quality score of the dataset (0-100).
  - **players**: Total number of players in the dataset.
  - **bots**: Number of bot players in the dataset.
  - **human_players**: Number of human players in the dataset.
  - **board_size**: Size of the game board.
  - **units**: Total number of units in the dataset.
  - **bv**: Battle value of the dataset.

### Example JSON

```json
{
  "unitActions": [...],
  "gameStates": [...],
  "gameBoard": {...},
  "tags": [...],
  "notes": "original file name: example.tsv",
  "properties": {
    "id": 1,
    "quality": 25,
    "players": 4,
    "bots": 2,
    "human_players": 2,
    "board_size": [32, 32],
    "units": 10,
    "bv": 8600
  }
}
```

## File Naming Convention

The filenames of the tagged datasets follow a specific format to encode key characteristics of the dataset:

```
tagged dataset q=<quality> a=<actions> p=<players> u=<units> bv=<battle_value> d=<date> t=<time> id=<id>.json
```

### Filename Components

- **q**: Quality score of the dataset (0-100).
- **a**: Number of actions in the dataset.
- **p**: Number of players in the dataset.
- **u**: Number of units in the dataset.
- **bv**: Total battle value of the dataset.
- **d**: Date when the dataset was created (format: YYYY-MM-DD).
- **t**: Local time when the dataset was created (format: HH-MM-SS).
- **id**: Unique identifier for the dataset during tagging.

### Example Filename

```
tagged dataset q=025 a=1200 p=4 u=10 bv=008600 d=2025-01-01 t=12-00-00 id=1.json
```

- **q=025**: Quality score is 25.
- **a=1200**: The dataset contains 1200 actions.
- **p=4**: There are 4 players in the dataset.
- **u=10**: The dataset includes 10 units.
- **bv=008600**: The total battle value is 8600.
- **d=2025-01-01**: The dataset was created on January 1, 2025.
- **t=12-00-00**: The dataset was created at 12:00:00.
- **id=1**: The unique identifier for this dataset is 1.
